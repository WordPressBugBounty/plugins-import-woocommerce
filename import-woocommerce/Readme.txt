== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**1. How do I import WooCommerce products?**

Importing your products is a straightforward process:

* **Go to the Importer:** In your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the "Ultimate CSV Importer" section.
* **Upload Your File:** Upload your CSV or XML file containing your product data.
* **Select Product Post Type:** Choose "WooCommerce Products" as the post type you're importing.  This tells the importer what kind of data it's handling.
* **Map Your Fields:**  This is the most important step!  The importer will show you the columns in your CSV/XML file and the corresponding fields in WooCommerce (like product name, price, description, etc.).  Carefully match (or "map") your column headers to the correct WooCommerce fields. This ensures your data goes where it belongs.
* **Start the Import:** Click the "Import" button. The plugin will begin importing your products.
* **Check Your Results:**  Once the import finishes, check both the front end of your website (how customers see it) and the back end (your WordPress admin area) to make sure your products are imported correctly.

**2. Is there a file size limit?**

Yes, there are limits. The maximum file size you can upload depends on your server's configuration.  The key setting is `upload_max_filesize`, and it should be at least 2MB (or larger, depending on how many products you're importing). You can usually find this setting in your web hosting control panel or by contacting your hosting provider. Some plugins may have additional limits or ways around this.

**3. How do I import product images?**

Product images are imported along with your product data.  In your CSV/XML file, you'll need a column specifically for image URLs.  The column header might be something like "Product Image," "Featured Image," or "Image URL."  In this column, you'll put the full web address (URL) of each product's image.  Make sure the images are already hosted online somewhere accessible.

**4. How do I import product categories and tags?**

Just like images, categories and tags are handled in your import file.  Create separate columns for each.  For example, one column could be "Product Categories" and another "Product Tags."  If a product belongs to multiple categories or has multiple tags, separate them with commas in the cell.  For example: "Shirts, T-Shirts, Clothing" (for categories) or "men's fashion, summer clothes" (for tags).

**5. How do I import product reviews?**

Importing reviews is a great way to build social proof.  Your import file needs to include the review data (e.g., reviewer name, review text, rating, and the product the review belongs to).  When you upload the file, choose "WooCommerce Reviews" as the post type.  Map the columns in your file to the corresponding review fields in WooCommerce.

**6. Can I use external URLs for images?**

Yes, you can use external URLs (web addresses) for your *featured* product images.  However, for images *inside* the product description (what we call "inline images"), you'll typically need to use shortcodes.

**7. How do I include images within the product description?**

To add images *within* the product description text, you'll use shortcodes.  A common method is to first upload your images to a folder (or a zip file) on your web server. Then, in your product description in your import file, you would use a shortcode that points to those images. The exact shortcode will depend on the plugin you are using.

**8. Why is the import button disabled?**

The "Import" button won't be clickable until you've successfully uploaded a CSV or XML file. If you've uploaded a file and the button is still disabled, double-check that your file is saved in UTF-8 format. This is a common requirement for import tools.  Most spreadsheet programs allow you to save files in UTF-8.

**9. How to Import WooCommerce Customers?**  

To [import WooCommerce customers](https://www.smackcoders.com/documentation/wp-ultimate-csv-importer-pro/import-woocommerce-customers?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=import_woocommerce), follow these steps:  

1. Prepare a CSV or XML file with customer details, including name, email, billing, and shipping addresses.  
2. Open the **WP Ultimate CSV Importer** plugin in WordPress.  
3. Upload your CSV/XML file and choose **WooCommerce Customers** as the post type.  
4. Map the fields in your file to the corresponding WooCommerce customer attributes.  
5. Click **Import**, and the plugin will process the file, automatically adding the customers to WooCommerce.
